# Guides

These keystone guides have been written both to get you set up with keystone, as well as help explain the concepts keystone is using, to help you understand how to get the most out of your project.

If you are coming from Keystone 4, and are looking to upgrade, read through our [upgrade guide](/guides/v-0-3-to-v-4-0-upgrade-guide)

If you are planning on starting with the keystone generator, the [yo generator](/getting-started/yo-generator) is the best place to begin, and will walk you through the parts of the generator so you can understand your new project.

If you want to implement keystone from scratch without the generator, the [setting up](/getting-started/setting-up/part-1) is the best place to start.

Our other guides deal with more specific topics that not every keystone user will need, however which deserve a bit more explanation than just an API reference.
