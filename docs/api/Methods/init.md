# Init

## `Keystone.init(options:Object)`

`Keystone.init` provides initial options to keystone. These are used to format and customise how keystone runs.

Some properties can be provided to init but not to [set](/api/methods/set):

- cloudinary config
- auth
- nav
- mongo
- module root
- app
- mongoose
- frame guard

The initialization options can be found in the [configuration](/documentation/configuration) documentation.

For information on setting up keystone, see the [installation guide](/getting-started/setting-up/part-1)
